#
#   When the WSGI server loads your application, Django needs to import the settings module, that's where 
#   you entire application is defined.
#
#   Django uses the DJANGO_SETTING_MODULE environment variable to locate the appropriate settings module
#   It must contain the dotted path to the settings module.
#
#   You can use a different value for development and production; it all depends on how you organize your settings.
#
#   If this variable isn't set, the default wsgi.py sets it to mysite.settings (e.g. schoolproject.settings), 
#   where mysite is the name of your project. That's how runserver discovers the default settings file by default.
